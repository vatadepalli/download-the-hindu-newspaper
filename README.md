# The Hindu Downloader

A simple python and selenium based script to download "The Hindu" newspaper.

You will need to have a subscription to - https://epaper.thehindu.com/

I just run this script as a daily once job on my machine - and have the newspaper downloaded to my desktop. - Just like a dog fetching your newspaper
